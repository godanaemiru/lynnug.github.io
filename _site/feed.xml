  &lt;p&gt;“The mystery of being is a permanent mystery, at least given the present state of the human brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My workmates(all programmers) and I keep having an agrument about the possibilty of there being a robot that exactly like a human being. One that feels and has thought. I differ and believe that our being is not a piece a software that can easily be recreated. I prefer to see technology as way human beings can extend themselves.Our being is a phenomena, a mystery. A beautiful thing thats unexplainable.I shall enjoy it that while my workmates ponder on how to create it. &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I got the opportunity to use MVC4.I happened to gotten fond of it and thought I should give a small blog post about it. I won’t get into depth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros
-MVC4 has pretty solid libraries(ones used so far) that make building software easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Pretty solid documentation and tutorials for beginners&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Running MVC4 is pretty easy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Easy Debugging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons
-Strong typing which comes with C sharp. Coming from python background , this gets to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The application takes forever to start-up when launched&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Seems like visual studio is the ideal environment thus your forced to use windows as your operating system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Not open source. I keep seeing an icon reminding me some sort of visual studio license is about to expire and I work for start-up that uses Biz Spark resources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still exploring MVC4 so this post will have more to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That is the way to learn the most, that when you are doing something with such enjoyment that you don’t notice that the time passes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love to learn and I love to learn through people.Think its the best and easiet way(got me through undergrad). Especially if your learning across fields.This weekend I’ve had to jump through multiple fields from mechincal engineering to stastics to economics. And this how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin is an aspiring mechanic and recently got into technical school. He sought my help to help with his theoretical work which includes electronics and engines. My electronics knowledge is okay but my engine knowledge is wanting. But on opening up a text book about engines , I was blown away by the design of an engine. My cousin and I spent the entire Saturday talking about engines , him bring his practical experience and I bring the theory. Theoretical I’m on my way to becoming a mechanic. May add I loved the electronics (conductors , semi conductors and insulators).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little brother is an aspiring economist. He has a significant amount of statistics homework in particular to do with Stochastic processes. This was one of my favorite topics in networks ,so on Friday I was up reading up on Markov’s chain. Well arriving at the study session , I turned into the students. Turns out I’m great at the calculations just terrible at translating it to real world problems. My little brother schooled me Markov’s properties and what means to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Dad is an economist. He loves economic critical analysis(especially of Uganda). He tends to use me as a thinking board. I like to take part in the discussions but this requires one to involve themselves economics reading regarding not only Uganda but the world.  I’m glad I take this challenge on as it opens my mind thus disclosing new worlds to me from economic perspective. After his talks , I yearn to be farmer or gone to a vocational school . For two hours a day , I’m an amateur economist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well its Monday , time to be a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I moved my blog from blogspot to github. II got lazy and also spend more time in my text editor (feel more comfortable writing stuff here). Also git push a thing I like to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried migrating my old blogs from blogger , its more difficult than I thought. I found a node.js library blogger2jekyll but it conversion isn’t liked by my current version so it needs some debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well to new beginings :)&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love programming. I tend to go into a meditative state(which I enjoy) when I write code where I disconnect with the world and my thoughts connect with code. I currently work for a small start-up company called accessmobile that allows to do that and at the same time create products that hope to disrupt the Ugandan market in areas of agriculture and health. I work with a great team and a great view of Kampala City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently on my team I’m the only female and I tend to hang around many tech circles in Kampala and female presence is wanting. I felt I needed to do something about female presence in the Kampala tech scene especially as developers. Many male developers who happen to be my friends don’t see a need for the push as they didn’t receive a push while entering this field. Well unfortunately I feel different , I can’t watch an ecosystem in its infancy grow to and leave women behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last two months , I have been running a python class at the Women in technology centre(WITU) in Kampala every Friday evening for two hours. The turn up was great on the first day , many ladies were excited to learn python and games programming(another class run by workmates). I have to recommend WITU on availing computers as some ladies don’t earn personal laptops but are keen to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the next week not so much, and over the next weeks we had a negative linear relationship .The feedback I got was the class was too difficult(feedback given when I arrived to topic of “for loops”). Besides that I offered weekly assignment and only a few of the ladies attempted while others didn’t attempt but were keen to collect notes on the “correct answers”. Any programmer out there who writes code for a living knows coding is about problem solving with active action not keeping note of “correct answers” which is passive. I tried to convey that in during my classes and even brought another female coder (Emily from Thoughtworks) to talk the ladies about taking action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well this didn’t kill my zeal , I went to every class with excitement to teach and also learn from my students. I also carried along candy to every class to encourage my students.I must say I’m proud of the few who remained. Below are three of my students who pulled through a microsoft developer boot camp :) . I also have a health worker who attended my class and now is on her way to building her own health web applications(she’s just gotten past the django intro page), an ecnomist who thinks python would be great for data crunching and a web developer who would like to explore outside of the borders of drupal.&lt;/p&gt;
