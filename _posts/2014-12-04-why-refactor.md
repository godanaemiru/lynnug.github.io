Last month I got the opportunity to attend a talk on refactoring at thoughtworks Uganda geeknight by Martin Fowler (trying to look to link but I can't find it(again)). I think refactoring is a powerful concept yet very simple([Fowler's book](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672) on refactoring nails in chapter 1). I have met several developers who have brushed me off and told me their code I quote "works" and the structure doesn't matter. Well structure matters.

These are my four reasons for refactoring

#Katogo is great to eat but not good to read

Katogo is a traditional dish in Uganda  which consists of mixture of numerous ingredients and isusually eaten for breakfast. I happen to like it and usually don't turn down a plate however if your code looks like Katago , I usually turn down it.I won't lie I have produced my fair share of katogo code but I saw the error of my ways. Many programming languages have the power to abstract control structures in the form of classes , if statements are like salt too much of them leaves a bad taste in code. 


#Your code smells
Writing code is very similar to writing an essay. When your writing an essay no submits a draft as their final copy. A draft  helps you put out your arguments about something. Well now you have a draft , time to make it clear and straight to point. This where refactoring comes in. So that when you submit your code/essay people will know what your saying or convey.


#Repeation sucks
Oh my word I can't stress this more!!! Quote from the [pragmatic programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single ,unambiguous authoritiative representation within a system.

Enough said!


#Its a matter of economics
Without refactoring , developers are always going to be in technical debt which accumulates. And we all have to pay our debts. For a developer its time and if you work for a company this pretty much a waste of your company/clients time and money. Adding features to a product is painful , adding developers to a new team is painful , maintaining is painful!!
