Recently I got the opportunity to use MVC4.I happened to gotten fond of it and thought I should give a small blog post about it. I won't get into depth

Pros
-MVC4 has pretty solid libraries(ones used so far) that make building software easier.

-Pretty solid documentation and tutorials for beginners

-Running MVC4 is pretty easy

-Easy Debugging



Cons
-Strong typing which comes with C sharp. Coming from python background , this gets to me. 

-The application takes forever to start-up when launched

-Seems like visual studio is the ideal environment thus your forced to use windows as your operating system

-Not open source. I keep seeing an icon reminding me some sort of visual studio license is about to expire and I work for start-up that uses Biz Spark resources


I'm still exploring MVC4 so this post will have more to it.
