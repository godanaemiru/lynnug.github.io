I'm back to playing to playing around with codility to help improve on the code write. So I took the  Frogjmp test , below is my first submission. On submission , the results were better. Though my solution didn't accomodate certain cases and hence failed on half of them.
{% highlight python linenos %}
#Frogjmp , first solution
def solution(X,Y,D):
	#print float(Y-X)/float(D)
	return int(round(float(Y-X)/float(D)))
print solution (10,80,30)
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a revised solution that solves all cases
{% highlight python linenos %}
#Frogjmp  , revised solution
def solution2(X, Y, D):
    distance = Y - X
    if distance % D == 0:
        return distance/D
    else:
        return distance/D + 1
print solution (10,80,30)
{% endhighlight %}
