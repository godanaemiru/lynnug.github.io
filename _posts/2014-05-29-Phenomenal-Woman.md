>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
>I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size
>But when I start to tell them,
>They think I’m telling lies.
>I say,
>It’s in the reach of my arms,
>The span of my hips,
>The stride of my step,
>The curl of my lips.
>I’m a woman
>Phenomenally.
>Phenomenal woman,
>That’s me.
