>“The mystery of being is a permanent mystery, at least given the present state of the human brain.”

My workmates(all programmers) and I keep having an agrument about the possibilty of there being a robot that exactly like a human being. One that feels and has thought. I differ and believe that our being is not a piece a software that can easily be recreated. I prefer to see technology as way human beings can extend themselves.Our being is a phenomena, a mystery. A beautiful thing thats unexplainable.I shall enjoy it that while my workmates ponder on how to create it.
