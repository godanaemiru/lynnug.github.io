I moved my blog from blogspot to github. II got lazy and also spend more time in my text editor (feel more comfortable writing stuff here). Also git push a thing I like to do.

I tried migrating my old blogs from blogger , its more difficult than I thought. I found a node.js library blogger2jekyll but it conversion isn't liked by my current version so it needs some debugging.

Well to new beginings :)
