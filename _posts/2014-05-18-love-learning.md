>“That is the way to learn the most, that when you are doing something with such enjoyment that you don’t notice that the time passes.” 

I love to learn and I love to learn through people.Think its the best and easiet way(got me through undergrad). Especially if your learning across fields.This weekend I've had to jump through multiple fields from mechincal engineering to stastics to economics. And this how:

My cousin is an aspiring mechanic and recently got into technical school. He sought my help to help with his theoretical work which includes electronics and engines. My electronics knowledge is okay but my engine knowledge is wanting. But on opening up a text book about engines , I was blown away by the design of an engine. My cousin and I spent the entire Saturday talking about engines , him bring his practical experience and I bring the theory. Theoretical I'm on my way to becoming a mechanic. May add I loved the electronics (conductors , semi conductors and insulators).

My little brother is an aspiring economist. He has a significant amount of statistics homework in particular to do with Stochastic processes. This was one of my favorite topics in networks ,so on Friday I was up reading up on Markov's chain. Well arriving at the study session , I turned into the students. Turns out I'm great at the calculations just terrible at translating it to real world problems. My little brother schooled me Markov's properties and what means to learn.


My Dad is an economist. He loves economic critical analysis(especially of Uganda). He tends to use me as a thinking board. I like to take part in the discussions but this requires one to involve themselves economics reading regarding not only Uganda but the world.  I'm glad I take this challenge on as it opens my mind thus disclosing new worlds to me from economic perspective. After his talks , I yearn to be farmer or gone to a vocational school . For two hours a day , I'm an amateur economist. 

Well its Monday , time to be programmer.
