#The myth
Ultimate geek fantasy is to go off to your cave and write a tonne of code only to come out as the genius programmer that shocks the world. Well those don't exsist(or rarely) People usually work in cave in order to hide their flaws.

#Why should you care about this myth?
This usually results in no progress. Code quality is low and reduces the bus factor. Bus factor is the number of people on a software project that need to be hit by a bus that results in an insane amount of hell.

#New Guidelines
Instead of working solo ,  Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman (googlers )to improve code quality and reduce bus factr software should be built as team and with as open communication as possible.

* Drop the Ego. Working for the greater good of your software instead of your small clever piece of code that will be sloted in

* Criticism is not evil. Interacting with people is very important. Code reviews are great way of getting feedback and increases the bus factor

* Embrace failure except when you fail several times on the samething. Failing on something new means your learning something new. Also fail fast and practice more.

* Be small fish in the pond. Big fish in the pond feel safe and don't get better but small fish have the chance to grow.

* Be vulnerable. Admit your mistakes.

#Overcoming the myth

Currently I'm a very small fish . Inorder to grow 

* Starting this blog to put myself out there.

* Contributing to open source projects. The current open source projects I'm exploring are [Vumi](https://github.com/praekelt/vumi) and [OpenMRS](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core) .These tools will aid in helping become a better programmer but also come up with solutions that can be used at the problems we are solving at [AccessMobile]()
