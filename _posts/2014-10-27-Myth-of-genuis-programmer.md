#Women in passion programme
Being part of the team running the  [Women in Passion Programme](http://www.wopa.outbox.co.ug/about-wopa-program) at a local incubation hub Outbox has taught many things , biggest one is the power of a team where each member plays their role for the greater good of our ultimate goal. This team on a very tight budget has been able to achieve a quite alot and has been very honest with its achievements(also threatening to call it quits if we didn't meet our goal). Enough about that , this brought to thinking about Software development , teams and solo programmers.

#The myth
The ultimate geek fantasy is to go off to your cave and write a tonne of code only to come out as the genius programmer that shocks the world. Well those don't exist(or rarely).Usually work in cave in order to hide their flaws.

#Why should you care about this myth?
This usually results in no progress. Code quality is low and reduces the bus factor. Bus factor is the number of people on a software project that need to be hit by a bus that results in an insane amount of hell.

#New Guidelines
Instead of working solo , Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman (googlers ) believe to improve code quality and increase bus factor software should be built as team and with as open communication as possible.

* Drop the Ego. Working for the greater good of your software instead of your small clever piece of code that will be sloted into the code base. Teams build great products , not individuals. Using world cup as an example.

* Criticism is not evil. Interacting with people is very important. Code reviews are great way of getting feedback and increases the bus factor for your team. I'm currently moving away from using function based views in django to class based views and this after getting feedback from two colleagues.  

* Embrace failure except when you fail several times on the samething(hmmm on this one). Failing on something new means your learning something new. Also fail fast and practice more.

* Be small fish in the pond. Big fish in the pond feel safe and don't get better but small fish have the chance to grow. Everyday I wake up hoping i'm a small fish (hoping not to get eaten)

* Be vulnerable. Admit your mistakes.

#Overcoming the myth

Currently I'm a very small fish . Inorder to grow  I'm taking the following steps:

* Starting this blog to put myself out there.

* Contributing to open source projects. The current open source projects I'm exploring are [Vumi](https://github.com/praekelt/vumi) and [OpenMRS](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core) .These tools will aid in helping become a better programmer but also come up with solutions that can be used at the problems we are solving at [AccessMobile](http://accessmobileinc.com/)

*In [AccessMobile team](http://accessmobileinc.com/about/team/) , I strongly push for code reviews!!
