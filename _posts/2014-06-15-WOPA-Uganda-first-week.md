This week marked the start of WOPA Uganda which is the Women in Passion Programme that aims to increase the number of women participants on the general technology scene in Uganda. I'm part of the programme as a technical facilitator. I've run quite a number of coding camps for girls however this has got to be my favourite as the process of training is holistic. Holistic for both the facilitators and the students.  Holistic in the sense that it focuses on the people and not the content.

For the  first week we had something called life maps which basically had all participants (both facilitators and students) map out their lives in terms of people , career , education, challenges , affirmations and aspirations.  Life maps forced everybody out of their comfort zones but also at the same time inspired each one of us. Life maps also made each one of the participants feel like the programme was to help them grow as developers/ entrepreneurs not just throw chunks of knowledge at the them. Because of this particpation from everyone has been pretty natural , everyone arrives for the sessions well before actual time and always tries to share.

Well  I'm looking forward to the rest of the programme which runs over next three months.
