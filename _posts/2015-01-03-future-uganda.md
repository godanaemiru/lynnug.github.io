I think the future of tech in Uganda is exciting however it has a huge amount of complexity surrounding it. This article unfortunately doesn't predict what the future will look like however it will look at the current technology puzzle who's complexity keeps increasing.
One's thing for sure the future will have a mobile in it however the form and platforms ,I can't tell. Beautiful thing about this scenario is that the users in Uganda are getting closer to their mobile devices , the more services are provided on those device. Many Ugandans have a phone with them 24 hours a day, the sheer power of this is crazy. In Uganda with the advent of mobile money and payments through a ussd interface, mobile phones have become life lines for more than half of the Ugandan population. The number of times I've heard "send it via mobile"  could possibly be over a million times.  "send via mobile" is Ugandan slang for perform a money transaction with the aid of your mobile phone. This "send it via mobile" cuts across income brackets in Uganda from rich to middle class to low income.  

With this below are the current trends that are a glimpse of the potential  of mobile technology:

#Anne Kansiime

Anne Kansiime the most successful Ugandan technology start up that has gone to scale outside of Uganda. Anne Kansiime two years ago was a little known comedian with a youtube channel that started with a few segments watched by mainly Ugandans and slowly trickled into other countries especially sub-Saharan Africa.In particular Kenya. Not sure the impact Anne Kansiime  was looking when she posted her first videos on youtube however I doubt the outcome was a full on tech start up with a working business model. For anyone who follows tech scene and its business models , advertising  is not a sustainable business model especially in Uganda and in many African countries. Another business model was Anne Kansiime could have taken is selling her work online per video however that business model too has it limits and this has been proved in the Nigerian music industry. Anne Kansiime was able to come up with a better business model which is on ground shows where people had to come watch her perform. Youtube was more medium to share to her amazing work and acquire a new fan base that could be anywhere in the world.  Anne Kansiime  had the privilege of having sold out shows in Kenya. Anne Kansiime's scenario presents two industries which is technology and comedy interacting to give unusual avenue for success. This gives us the ability to re-imagine our entertainment industry and the wider market that's out there for us. This wider market can be found in web browser that are probably in mobile devices.
Below is what I believe was Anne Kansiime first viral video. Many African women can relate to her stories (I inclusive) which has attributed to her success

#Whatsapp

Recently in Uganda , there was a viral video of a Ugandan maid unfortunately torturing a baby. This video was first placed on youtube however it was later on taken down. However this didn't stop the video from travelling on whatsapp freely which spurred a huge debt amongst the middle class of Uganda. I won't go into the details of the debt however it opened my eyes to an ecosystem that's growing and will explode once the right quorum of users have joined. This ecosystem lives on mobile devices and is found on a mobile app of the device.
By the way this same ecosystem that fostered nude leaks of two "celebrities" in Uganda. 


#Ecommerce

I didn't believe Ecommerce was a possibility in Uganda. Oh boy was I wrong since my basis was on local Ugandan startups.  Turns out Rocket internet decided to set up shop in Uganda along with Naspers. Rocket internet backs three companies hellofood.ug , kaymu.com.ug, jumia.ug while Naspers backs olx.co.ug. These companies come back with a significant amount of cash which has given them the opportunity to carry a huge amount of activations all the online ads in my browser are either hellofood.ug or kaymu.com.ug . Besides online they advertise on pretty much every major billboard in Kampala , run radio adverts and occasionally hand out flyers in local malls. These companies couldn't time have picked a better time as traffic jams have a reached an ever high with many Ugandans opting not to go to restaurants and stores. With an efficient network of motorcycles (locally known as boda boda), these companies are able to navigate Kampala traffic easily and make a delivery. No Ugandan startup could afford to do that. The repercussions of this are for another blog post bad and good.
Below is a video created by one of the ecommerce franchises that jumps on popular culture(music industry has reach a certain level of maturity in Uganda)

#Mobile payments

Mobile payments are popular in Uganda so popular I would translate to what the west has for credit cards. I pay all my bills via USSD that includes purchasing data bundles and airtime. This highlights that USSD and sms are going to be in our future.

#Discover Uganda

This gets special mention as I have always had my eyes on the tourism industry in Uganda.  The tourism sector in Uganda contributes roughly 4.6 percent to its GDP which is roughly 834 million dollars. The reason for the failure of the tourism is poor marketing . Well I see a gap for tech to jump in and  multiply that dollar ,Discover Uganda is taking that jump.  Check out one of their episodes below

With the services mentioned above , one can see the complexity which I see in 2 dimensions which are the people(Uganda's population is evolving with people in the low income bracket to middle class ) , the devices(I believe this is mobile phones arena however this is varies from non Smartphone to Smartphone(which also varies in operating systems ) ).

To all those trying to invent the tech future in Uganda , good luck !! Looking forward to future .
