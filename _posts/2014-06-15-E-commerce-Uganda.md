>Electronic commerce, commonly known as E-commerce or ecommerce, is trading in products or services conducted via computer networks such as the Internet. This is the definition I got off Wikipedia. 

After reading "The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon" , I've become a little more fascinated (I already was)by the internet ,its potential especially in regard to Uganda/Africa and how its only African ninjas (somebody who sets out to build the future despite the obstacles and not just predict it) are going to get us there. Bezo is truly a ninja ,he started selling books online from his home which grew into the amazon the everything store then into amazon webs services and then the kindle. He was such a ninja that his competitors thought he was crazy and couldn't keep up with him. Bezo made it his sole mission to understand and serve his customers which is why he's pretty successful. 

Which brings me back to the Ugandan E-commerce landscape , I've talked a number of entrepreneurs /developers and they always talking the thousands of constraints to setting up an E-commerce sites in Uganda  .  Well there's ninjas out there who are attempting to jump those constraints and might actually be successful at this. I know Uganda's middle class is small however one's thing is for sure they love to consume (which sadly doesn't reflect the state of our economy). 20 years from now that middle class would probably have increased in size and those ninjas will surely be there to serve them.I recently discovered www.alexa.com which is a website that ranks other website globally and locally according to country. This allowed to locate potential ninjas who are taking a shot at e-commerce in Uganda.

## Number  1

http://www.eyetrade.ug/
When I typed online shopping Uganda , this search was among the top searches. This is owned by Ugandans.First of all their user interface is very basic and gave me the impression that their aim is to serve the customer and not give a fancy looking website. The guys behind this e-commerce might not be millionaires(according to US dollars) but I'm pretty sure they are able to pay their bills and also have Ugandans attention.  Below is their alexa.com score.

## Number 2 

http://www.cheki.co.ug/
These didn't from a google search but from my mother, brother and friends who happen to be looking to cars all mentioned this site to me.  This site is started by Kenyan-Australian Internet entrepreneur Carey Eaton who sadly passed away recently in truly unfortunate circumstances. He also was a true ninja who pioneered cheki in Kenya which is pretty popular there and also in Uganda. This no surprise as second hand vehicles are a hot commodity amongst the middle class in Uganda.Below is their score from alexa.

## Number 3 

http://www.kaymu.co.ug/ 
These I obtained from a google search and they are pretty new to the market. This site happens to be backed by a European company(Rocket internet) which happens to have millions of dollars , none the less they have Ugandans attention according to alexa.com. The first thing that caught my eye on this site is the price tags, products were going for as low as 3000 Ugandan shillings which created the impulse in me to actually shop there. Below is their alexa.com score

Above are the ninja who venturing for a very scary landscape.I believe our pioneers in e-commerce will not come from obvious places and probably not find them pitching ideas at start-up competitions , but out there working hard to win over Ugandan customers.
